# Credit Scoring Prediction 
## ðŸ“Œ Explanation

### 1. Installing Libraries
Essential Python libraries are imported to handle data processing, visualization, and machine learning tasks:
- **pandas, numpy** â†’ Data manipulation and numerical computations  
- **matplotlib** â†’ Visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â†’ Preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation  
- **faker** â†’ Generating synthetic data

### 2. Generating the Dataset
Since real credit scoring datasets are private and sensitive, a **synthetic dataset** is generated using:
- **NumPy** â†’ For numerical distributions (income, credit score, age, credit history).  
- **Faker** â†’ To simulate realistic data samples.  

The dataset contains **1000 records** with the following columns:
- `income` â†’ Annual income of the person  
- `age` â†’ Age of the person  
- `credit_history` â†’ Credit history length/score  
- `credit_score` â†’ Target label (ranges from 300 to 850)

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is performed before training the model:
- Standardization using **StandardScaler**.  
- Creating a preprocessing pipeline with **ColumnTransformer**.  
- Splitting the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`).

### 4. Splitting the Data
The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set (80%)** â†’ Used for training the model.  
- **Testing set (20%)** â†’ Used to evaluate performance.  

A fixed **random_state** ensures reproducibility of results.

### 5. Training the Regression Model
A **Ridge Regression** model is used because it performs well with continuous numerical predictions and avoids overfitting using L2 regularization.  

Steps include:
1. Creating a **pipeline** with preprocessing and Ridge regression.  
2. Performing **hyperparameter tuning** with `GridSearchCV`.  
3. Training the model on the dataset.  

---

### 6. Evaluating the Model
The model is evaluated on the test dataset using:
- **RÂ² Score** â†’ Measures goodness of fit.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** â†’ Measures prediction error.  

Example results:
- Best Ridge parameters found via GridSearch.  
- RÂ² Score: ~0.85  
- MSE: Low, meaning good accuracy.

### 7. Making Predictions with New Data
A function `predict_credit_score()` is created to predict a credit score based on new input values:
- Example input:  
  - Income = 60000  
  - Age = 35  
  - Credit history = 5  

- Example output:  Predicted credit score: 678.45
